# Self driving car on nanodegree driving simulator

This repository contains the code to train a Convolutional Neural Network for nanodegree Udacity driving simulator in pytorch.
`model.py` contains the model to be trained so you can even train your custom model. `data_processing.py` extracts the data from the .xml file and after balencing the data ti saves it as a numpy file.
`training_file.py` then uses that numpy file to train your network.
